Hello and welcome to Jayden Lin's AP Computer Science A Final Project **2048**. 
To whoever is reading this, I have finally added the tile images to the repository, thus the GUI *should* work on not just my computer now lol. 
As silly as it sounds, I finally got around to learning how to move around files on my MacBook Pro. 
I made this project in May-June of 2024. 
To run the TUI version, run Game.java. 
To run the GUI version, run GameFrame.java. 
All of the logic can be found in TwentyFortyEight.java. 
The logic may have some wild inefficiencies that were brute force hard coded and I didn't know better at the time. 
The spawning of tiles may not 100% match the logic of the actual 2048 game. 
There is no win screen or point scores... however I might come back to that on a rainy day.
