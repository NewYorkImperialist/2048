Hello and welcome to Jayden Lin's AP Computer Science A Final Project **2048**
To whoever is reading this, I have finally added the tile images to the repository, thus the GUI *should* work on not just my computer now lol
As silly as it sounds, I finally got around to learning how to move around files on my MacBook Pro
I made this project in May-June of 2024
To run the TUI version, run Game.java
To run the GUI version, run GameFrame.java
All of the logic can be found in TwentyFortyEight.java
The logic may have some wild inefficiencies that were brute force hard coded and I didn't know better at the time
The spawning of tiles may not 100% match the logic of the actual 2048 game
There is no win screen or point scores... however I might come back to that on a rainy day
